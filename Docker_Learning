Docker is a open source tool that helps to package an application and its dependenices so it runs same on any system. We use docker in DevOps to eliminate OS issues, to use CI/CD pipelines, Base for Kubernetes and known for lightweight compared to VM.

DockerFile Concepts:

Image: Blueprint of an app
Container: Running instance of an image
Dockerfile: Instructions to build an image

Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu:latest
Run apt update &&  apt install -y curl
CMD["echo", "Hello DevOps from Docker"]

Basic Commands On Docker:

## Image Commands
docker pull ubuntu
docker images
docker rmi image_id

## Container Commands

docker ps
docker ps -a
docker stop container_id
docker rm container_id

## Build Image

## Run Container
docker run my-first-image

Example: 
we will try with a ngnix/DockerFile:
FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
