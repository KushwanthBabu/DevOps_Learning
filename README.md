Day 1
#Learning_GitHub Commands and Meaning of each
1. git clone: When you want to work on a exisiting repository we use this command, this helps to get past contributions and modifications happened in exisitng repo

2. git status: for suppose i've modified a readme in my local system along with that i created a new dockerfile in the system path, so when we run git status it shows the modified and untracked files.

3. git add: this command helps to add files in staging area before commiting them

4. git commit: to save the version of the files with a message like a snapshot or id

5. git push origin main: this command helps to send saved changes to GitHub, others can see the work and can start pipelines from here

6. git pull: can fetch other commits and edit in local system

7. git checkout: we use this command in branches to ensure everything is fine before commiting in main.

8. git merge: after knowing everything is safe, merge changes to main.
